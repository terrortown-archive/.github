# TTT Addon archive
<sub>Made by [@ellatonin](https://github.com/ellatonin)</sub>

I'm attempting to save copies of Garry's Mod TTT scripts.


# Why?

I was inspired to do this by this (https://www.tttarchive.co.uk) project which I found when I was nostalgic for this time period of my life.

I would highly encourage anyone who has any custom or obscure addons lying around to upload them so this history can be preserved.
